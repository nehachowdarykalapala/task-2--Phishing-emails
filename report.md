# Analysis of a Suspected Phishing Email  

## Introduction  
Phishing attacks are one of the most common ways cybercriminals attempt to steal sensitive information.  
In this document, I am examining a suspicious email that appears to be from a bank.  
The aim is to break down its content and technical details to understand how it tries to deceive the user and why it should be treated as unsafe.  

---

## Snapshot of the Email  
- **Subject Line:** Action Required: Verify Your Account Immediately  
- **From Address:** support@securebank.com (spoofed address)  
- **Date Received:** 05-Aug-2025  
- **Attachments:** None  
- **Embedded Links:** 1 login link  

The email pushes the user to verify their banking account without delay, which already raises doubts about its authenticity.

## Signs That Indicate Phishing  
1. **Mismatch in Sender Information**  
   The displayed email address looks official, but the actual sending server is unrelated to the real bank.  

2. **Pressure Tactics**  
   Words like *“Immediately”* and *“Action Required”* are commonly used to make the recipient act quickly.  

3. **Deceptive Hyperlink**  
   While the link text looks safe (`https://securebank.com/login`), hovering over it shows it redirects to  
   `http://malicious-server.net/auth`.  

4. **Unprofessional Language**  
   Mistakes such as *“verify your informations”* suggest that it was not written by a legitimate bank official.  

5. **No Personalization**  
   Instead of addressing the recipient by name, it simply uses *“Dear Customer.”*

## Header Analysis  
- **Source IP:** 185.231.223.45 (does not belong to the real bank)  
- **SPF Validation:** Failed  
- **DKIM:** Absent  
- **DMARC Policy:** Not found  

The above checks confirm that the message is not from the actual domain it pretends to be.  

---

## Possible Consequences if Trusted  
- **Theft of Login Credentials** — Victims may unknowingly provide their username and password.  
- **Financial Fraud** — Attackers could gain access to bank accounts.  
- **Misuse of Personal Information** — Data provided could be sold or used for further scams.  

---

## Recommended Actions  
- Do **not** click the provided link or respond to the email.  
- Report the suspicious message to the real bank’s support team.  
- Block the sender’s email address and IP.  
- Advise users to double-check links before clicking them.  
- Ensure devices are scanned for any malware.

## Conclusion  
Based on the content and technical checks, this email is confirmed to be a **phishing attempt**.  
It uses urgency, fake links, and poor personalization to trick the recipient.  
Raising awareness among users and reporting such emails promptly are the best defenses against these kinds of attacks.
